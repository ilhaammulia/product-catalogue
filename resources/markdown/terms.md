# Terms of Service

The BitDials platform was originally created as a shared-shop-service upon the request of a group of watch and jewellery dealerships who offer and sell using the BitDials platform on their own behalf and for their own account.

As a service, the BitDials platform does not participate as a party in the sales transaction and is not involved in billing customers. Additionally, the platform has no control over logistics and is not responsible for quality control. Logistics and quality control are centralized and managed by a third party, other than the BitDials platform, on behalf of the vendors.

It is essential to emphasize that the payment system utilized within the BitDials platform is provided by an external automated payment processor. The platform itself does not handle any payment transactions directly; instead, it focuses on facilitating the seamless integration and connection with the third-party payment processor, ensuring secure and efficient processing of payments.

The following paragraphs of these Terms & Conditions were standardized and agreed upon by the participating vendors. They outline the terms and conditions that govern the interaction between buyers and the actual sellers of goods within the BitDials platform.

Please note that the BitDials platform's role is strictly limited to providing a seamless and reliable service on behalf of participating dealerships. BitDials platform do not engage in trading activities or take part in the financial aspects of the sales process.

All references and mentions such as "we," "our," "us," etc., in these standardized terms refer to each individual participating vendor.
